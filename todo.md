# Rihla System Completion Todo

## Current Status: 45-50% Complete (REVISED AFTER TESTING)
**Goal**: Complete remaining 50-55% of functionality

## Phase 1: Fix Critical Frontend Issues and Navigation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Fix broken frontend routing (404 errors on all pages except dashboard) - WORKING PERFECTLY

- [ ] Connect Students page to Students API
- [ ] Connect Drivers page to Drivers API
- [ ] Connect Vehicles page to Vehicles API
- [ ] Connect Routes page to Routes API
- [ ] Connect Trips page to Trips API
- [ ] Connect Attendance page to Attendance API
- [ ] Connect Payments page to Payments API
- [ ] Connect Maintenance page to Maintenance API
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and loading states

## Phase 4: Build Complete CRUD Operations and Forms üìù
- [ ] Create Add/Edit forms for Students with validation
- [ ] Create Add/Edit forms for Drivers with validation
- [ ] Create Add/Edit forms for Vehicles with validation
- [ ] Create Add/Edit forms for Routes with validation
- [ ] Create Add/Edit forms for Trips with validation

- [ ] Create Add/Edit forms for Payments with validation
- [ ] Create Add/Edit forms for Maintenance with validation
- [ ] Implement search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Add pagination and sorting to data tables
- [ ] Implement delete operations with confirmation

## Phase 5: Implement Role-Based Access Control üîê
- [ ] Fix JWT authentication integration
- [ ] Implement proper role-based routing
- [ ] Create different dashboards for different user roles
- [ ] Restrict access to modules based on user roles
- [ ] Implement proper permission checks
- [ ] Test with different user roles (Admin, Manager, Driver, Parent)

## Phase 6: Complete Mobile Application Functionality üì±
- [ ] Test mobile app compilation and running
- [ ] Connect mobile app to backend APIs
- [ ] Implement real authentication in mobile app
- [ ] Add functional screens for all modules
- [ ] Test mobile app on different devices
- [ ] Implement offline functionality

## Phase 7: Testing, Bug Fixes, and System Integration üß™
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all modules
- [ ] Fix any bugs found during testing
- [ ] Test user workflows end-to-end
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Phase 8: Final Deployment and Delivery üöÄ
- [ ] Deploy updated frontend with all functionality
- [ ] Deploy updated backend with all APIs
- [ ] Test deployed system thoroughly
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Provide demo credentials and instructions
- [ ] Final system validation

## Critical Issues to Address:
1. **Broken Navigation**: Users cannot access any pages except dashboard
2. **Missing APIs**: 5 major APIs (Routes, Trips, Attendance, Payments, Maintenance) return 404
3. **No Real Data Integration**: Frontend shows static/mock data only
4. **No Working Forms**: Cannot add/edit any data from frontend
5. **Role-Based Access**: All users see identical dashboard regardless of role
6. **Mobile App**: Untested and likely non-functional

## Success Criteria:
- All 8 modules fully functional with CRUD operations
- Working navigation between all pages
- Real data integration between frontend and backend
- Role-based access control working properly
- Mobile app functional and tested
- System deployed and accessible
- User can perform all business operations
